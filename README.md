HQ Browser is a website allowing you to do web searches via different search engines - from Google to Wikipedia. It forms a searching string and passes it to a back-end server that further recognizes whether the string is a URL or a search request, and then redirects the user to a necessary page. Unfortunately, the back-end code is no longer available
